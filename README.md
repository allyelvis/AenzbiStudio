## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Git**: Version control to manage and clone the repository.
- **Node.js and npm**: Required for package management and running scripts.
- **Electron**: The main runtime for AenzbiStudio.

---

## Project Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone the AenzbiStudio repository and create a new feature branch.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/allyelvis/AenzbiStudio.git
   cd AenzbiStudio
   git checkout -b feature/aenzbistudio-complete-setup
   ```

2. **Set Up Directory Structure**  
   Run the following commands to create the necessary project directories:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p src/{editor,project-manager,build,debugger}
   mkdir -p docs tests scripts
   ```

---

## Installing Dependencies

This project uses **npm** for managing dependencies. The following dependencies are required:

- **Electron**: For building and running cross-platform applications.
- **Monaco Editor**: The code editor component.
- **Jest**: Testing framework for JavaScript.

Install the dependencies with retry logic in case of network issues:

```bash
npm init -y
```

```bash
# Retry logic for installing each package
attempt_install() {
  local package=$1
  local attempts=3
  local delay=5
  local success=0

  for ((i = 1; i <= attempts; i++)); do
    echo "Installing $package (attempt $i)..."
    npm install "$package" && success=1 && break
    echo "Failed to install $package. Retrying in $delay seconds..."
    sleep $delay
  done

  if [[ $success -ne 1 ]]; then
    echo "Error: Failed to install $package after $attempts attempts."
    exit 1
  fi
}

attempt_install electron
attempt_install monaco-editor
attempt_install jest
```

---

## Configuring Project Scripts

Update `package.json` to include custom scripts for building, testing, and running AenzbiStudio.

Replace your `package.json` with:

```json
{
  "name": "AenzbiStudio",
  "version": "1.0.1",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "electron .",
    "build": "electron-packager . AenzbiStudio --platform=all --out=dist",
    "test": "jest"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "electron": "^21.0.0",
    "monaco-editor": "^0.34.1"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "jest": "^29.0.0"
  }
}
```

---

## Building and Testing

### Running Tests

Before building, ensure all tests pass:

```bash
npm test
```

If tests fail, rerun them to confirm issues. Resolve any errors before proceeding.

### Building the Project

To compile the project for all platforms and create a distributable package:

```bash
npm run build
```

---

## Documentation Generation

Basic documentation is included to help users understand and navigate AenzbiStudio.

Create a `docs/README.md` with the following content:

```markdown
# AenzbiStudio Documentation

## Overview
AenzbiStudio is a powerful cross-platform IDE developed by Ally Elvis Nzeyimana.

## Installation
- Clone the repository and run \`npm install\` to install dependencies.

## Usage
- \`npm start\`: Start the IDE.
- \`npm run build\`: Build for distribution.

Refer to the full documentation for more details on each module.
```

---

## Versioning and Deployment

1. **Commit Changes**  
   After building and verifying functionality, commit all changes:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Complete setup and build for AenzbiStudio"
   ```

2. **Push to GitHub**  
   Push the feature branch to GitHub:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/aenzbistudio-complete-setup
   ```

3. **Tag the Version**  
   Tagging helps track specific versions and releases:

   ```bash
   git tag -a "v1.0.1" -m "Release v1.0.1: Complete setup for AenzbiStudio"
   git push origin "v1.0.1"
   ```

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Dependency Installation Issues**: If `npm install` fails, use the retry logic provided in the script above.
- **Build Failures**: Check error logs, confirm all dependencies are installed, and try running `npm rebuild` if needed.
- **Testing Failures**: Run tests individually and debug as necessary. Use `jest --watch` for real-time feedback.
